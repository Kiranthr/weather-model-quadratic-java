# 🌦️ Weather Modeling using Quadratic Equation - Java Project

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a simple **weather modeling system** using the **quadratic equation** formula in Java.

The purpose is to demonstrate:
- Application of quadratic equations in weather prediction.
- Step-by-step software development using the **Waterfall Model**.
- Java programming techniques.
- Version control using **Git and GitHub**.

## 🧱 Development Process (Waterfall Model Phases)
1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Solve weather modeling using quadratic equations.
2. **System Design**
   - Input: Coefficients (a, b, c) of the quadratic equation.
   - Output: Roots (temperature values).
3. **Implementation**
   - Java code with 4 stages:
     - Hardcoded input
     - Keyboard input
     - File input
     - Multiple inputs from file
4. **Testing**
   - Checked all versions for correct output and exceptions.
5. **Deployment**
   - Code pushed to GitHub repository.
6. **Maintenance**
   - Future updates will include real weather API integration.
